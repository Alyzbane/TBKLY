Some weights of MobileViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at apple/mobilevit-small and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 640]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([10, 640]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([10]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
